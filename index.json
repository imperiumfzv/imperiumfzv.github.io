A use case scenario was explored using recent abstracts and short summaries from the Sematic Scholar platform (baseline TLDR model - an acronym for “too long; didn’t read”). Four state-of-the-art models (OpenAI Davinci, OpenAI Curie, Pegasus-XSum, and BART-SAMSum) were used to generate short summaries. Ten healthcare experts evaluated five short summaries generated for each of the 20 included scientific paper abstracts. Results showed that Informativeness, Naturalness, and Quality were the highest in the baseline TLDR model with an average score of 4.87 (SD = 1.48), 4.94 (SD = 1.36), and 4.81 (SD = 1.5), respectively. No statistically significant differences between the baseline TLDR and OpenAI Curie/Davinci models were detected. The other two models, i.e., Pegasus-XSum and BART-SAMSum scored significantly lower in Informativeness and Quality. Our study demonstrated that we could effectively summarize scientific literature abstracts even with general AI-based text generation models such as OpenAI Curie and Davinci models. However, it should be noted that a higher variance was observed in the general models. Therefore, fine-tuning of the model is still recommended for practical use in the clinical environment.","tags":["Natural Language Processing","Human Evaluation","Healthcare"],"title":"Generating Extremely Short Summaries from the Scientific Literature to Support Decisions in Primary Healthcare: A Human Evaluation Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucija Gosak","Majda Pajnkihar, FAAN, FEANS","Gregor Štiglic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1655424000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655424000,"objectID":"461d69571afc8521adbd7a0d7dcf0d31","permalink":"/publication/jmir-rp_2022/","publishdate":"2022-06-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jmir-rp_2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Chronic diseases are a substantial public health issue worldwide and affect an individual’s quality of life. Due to the alarming rise in type 2 diabetes, health care that was primarily focused on diagnosis and treatment of the disease is increasingly focused on prevention and self-care. Patients who adhere to a constant and strict treatment regimen (physical activity, diet, medication) and regularly monitor their health are more likely to maintain self-care and health, prevent the exacerbation of the disease, and avoid the complications of diabetes (retinopathy, diabetic feet, etc). In recent years, many innovative devices that have become increasingly present in inpatient health care, such as mobile apps, are available to help patients maintain consistency in monitoring their health status. Mobile apps make it easier for individuals to monitor their self-care and illness and follow instructions regarding disease control. Objective: This study aims to determine the impact of mobile app use on self-care in patients with type 2 diabetes. We will evaluate and test the usefulness of the forDiabetes app as a tool to improve the self-care of individuals with type 2 diabetes. Methods: We will perform a double-blind randomized controlled trial. The study will include individuals aged over 18 years diagnosed with or have regulated type 2 diabetes who are treated in family medicine practices. Additionally, the individuals included in the study should not have any acute complications due to the consequences of type 2 diabetes. They will use an Android or iOS mobile phone and a blood glucose meter during the investigation. With the help of simple randomization, individuals will be divided into the intervention and control groups. Individuals in the intervention group will use the forDiabetes mobile app to monitor their self-care for type 2 diabetes. Individuals in the control group will not receive a particular intervention. Data will be collected using the Self-care of Diabetes Inventory questionnaire and Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire. Blood sugar, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and weight measurements will be monitored using calibrated instruments during the study by the nurses employed at the family medicine practice. Data will be collected at the beginning of the study and after a patient visits the family medicine practice. Results: In the first half of 2020, we have prepared a translation of the mobile app that will be used by the participants of the intervention group, as well as more detailed instructions for using the app. We have also prepared a translation of the questionnaires in Slovene. The research results will be published in 2023. Conclusions: This research contributes to greater visibility and usability of mobile apps for the self-care of patients with type 2 diabetes and raises awareness of the possible use of innovative methods.

One such task is abstractive text summarization combining understanding, information compression, and language generation, which might be of great potential in healthcare, where time is a premium. A potential real-world scenario is explored, where the relevance of extremely short summaries from the latest scientific literature is generated by state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and is evaluated by healthcare experts, and can be seen as support at the point of care. In a small-scale study, a baseline fine-tuned model (Semantic Scholar TLDR) was compared with three SOTA models (OpenAI Curie, OpenAI Davinci, and PEGASUS-XSum). Healthcare experts evaluated the abstracts and extremely short summaries considering the scenario and it was observed that in terms of relevance, the OpenAI models and Semantic Scholar TLDR model differed just slightly, i.e. OpenAI Curie model had the highest average score of 4.59 (SD=1.69), followed by with 4.58 (SD=1.58) and OpenAI Davinci with 4.48 (SD=1.87). On the other hand, the PEGASUS-XSum model's relevance was significantly lower, with 4.01 (SD=1.81). A deeper analysis of selected short summaries has shown that some concepts are difficult to understand for AI models that still have difficulty to “understand”, which often results in uninformative or false facts. One should be aware that extreme summarization using AI-based approaches is still a relatively new field of research and the technology is still not ready to be used in clinical practice. Our small-sample study indicates that it could already support the healthcare experts in the decision-making process.","tags":["Natural Language Processing","Relevance","Healthcare","Human Evaluation"],"title":"Relevance of automated generated short summaries of scientific abstract: use case scenario in healthcare","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon Kocbek","Primož Kocbek","Lucija Gosak","Nino Fijačko","Gregor Štiglic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1646006400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646006400,"objectID":"96ae1c988c6db5d56d652420799a17ba","permalink":"/publication/jpm_2022/","publishdate":"2022-02-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jpm_2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often results in high morbidity and mortality. In addition, T2DM presents a substantial financial burden for individuals and their families, health systems, and societies. According to studies and reports, globally, the incidence and prevalence of T2DM are increasing rapidly. Several models have been built to predict T2DM onset in the future or detect undiagnosed T2DM in patients. Additional to the performance of such models, their interpretability is crucial for health experts, especially in personalized clinical prediction models. Data collected over 42 months from health check-up examinations and prescribed drugs data repositories of four primary healthcare providers were used in this study. We propose a framework consisting of LogicRegression based feature extraction and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection operator based prediction modeling for undiagnosed T2DM prediction. Performance of the models was measured using Area under the ROC curve (AUC) with corresponding confidence intervals. Results show that using LogicRegression based feature extraction resulted in simpler models, which are easier for healthcare experts to interpret, especially in cases with many binary features. Models developed using the proposed framework resulted in an AUC of 0.818 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.812−0.823) that was comparable to more complex models (i.e., models with a larger number of features), where all features were included in prediction model development with the AUC of 0.816 (95% CI: 0.810−0.822). However, the difference in the number of used features was significant. This study proposes a framework for building interpretable models in healthcare that can contribute to higher trust in prediction models from healthcare experts.","tags":["LogicRegression","Type 2 diabetes mellitus","Interpretability","Prediction Models"],"title":"Extracting New Temporal Features to Improve the Interpretability of Undiagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Prediction Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor Štiglic","Ruth Masterson Creber","Leona Cilar Budler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643932800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643932800,"objectID":"21be42cf043ca339e44e429b5f073afe","permalink":"/publication/ijerph_2022/","publishdate":"2022-02-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ijerph_2022/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Although the internet facilitates access to a wide range of knowledge and evidence, overuse among young people is associated with lower wellbeing and psychosomatic symptoms.

Many colleges thus had to shift their education from personal to online form overnight. The educational environment itself has a significant influence on students’ learning outcomes, knowledge, and satisfaction. This study aims to validate the tool for assessing the educational environment in the Slovenian nursing student population. To assess the educational environment, we used the DREEM tool distributed among nursing students using an online platform. First, we translated the survey questionnaire from English into Slovenian using the reverse translation technique. We also validated the DREEM survey questionnaire. We performed psychometric testing and content validation. I-CVI and S-CVI are at an acceptable level. A high degree of internal consistency was present, as Cronbach’s alpha was 0.951. The questionnaire was completed by 174 participants, of whom 30 were men and 143 were women. One person did not define gender. The mean age of students was 21.1 years (SD = 3.96). The mean DREEM score was 122.2. The mean grade of student perception of learning was 58.54%, student perception of teachers was 65.68%, student academic self-perception was 61.88%, student perception of the atmosphere was 60.63%, and social self-perception of students was 58.93%.

Following the World Health Organization endorsement of the Kids Save Lives statements, initiatives to train school-age children in basic life support (BLS) have been widespread. Mobile phone apps, combined with gamification, represent an opportunity for including mobile learning (m-learning) in teaching schoolchildren BLS as an additional teaching method; however, the quality of these apps is questionable. Objective: This study aims to systematically evaluate the quality, usability, evidence-based content, and gamification features (GFs) of commercially available m-learning apps for teaching guideline-directed BLS knowledge and skills to school-aged children. Methods: We searched the Google Play Store and Apple iOS App Store using multiple terms (eg, cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR] or BLS). Apps meeting the inclusion criteria were evaluated by 15 emergency health care professionals using the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale and System Usability Scale. We modified a five-finger mnemonic for teaching schoolchildren BLS and reviewed the apps’ BLS content using standardized criteria based on three CPR guidelines. GFs in the apps were evaluated using a gamification taxonomy. Results: Of the 1207 potentially relevant apps, only 6 (0.49%) met the inclusion criteria. Most apps were excluded because the content was not related to teaching schoolchildren BLS. The mean total scores for the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale and System Usability Scale score were 3.2/5 points (95% CI 3.0-3.4) and 47.1/100 points (95% CI 42.1-52.1), respectively. Half of the apps taught hands-only CPR, whereas the other half also included ventilation. All the apps indicated when to start chest compressions, and only 1 app taught BLS using an automated external defibrillator. Gamification was well integrated into the m-learning apps for teaching schoolchildren BLS, whereas the personal and fictional, educational, and performance gamification groups represented most GFs. Conclusions: Improving the quality and usability of BLS content in apps and combining them with GFs can offer educators novel m-learning tools to teach schoolchildren BLS skills.","tags":["Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation","Basic Life Support","Mobile Learning","Mobile Phone","Gamification","Schoolchildren"],"title":"Evaluating Quality, Usability, Evidence-Based Content, and Gamification Features in Mobile Learning Apps Designed to Teach Children Basic Life Support: Systematic Search in App Stores and Content Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robin De Croon","Leen Van Houdt","Nyi Nyi Htun","Gregor Štiglic","Katrien Verbert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1624924800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1624924800,"objectID":"759945b16a63ad78362b4b06bfbeaff9","permalink":"/publication/jmir_2021/","publishdate":"2021-06-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jmir_2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Health recommender systems (HRSs) offer the potential to motivate and engage users to change their behavior by sharing better choices and actionable knowledge based on observed user behavior.

Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and synthesized the results. A total of 73 published studies that reported both an implementation and evaluation of an HRS targeted to laypersons were included and analyzed in this review. Results: Recommended items were classified into four major categories: lifestyle, nutrition, general health care information, and specific health conditions. The majority of HRSs use hybrid recommendation algorithms. Evaluations of HRSs vary greatly; half of the studies only evaluated the algorithm with various metrics, whereas others performed full-scale randomized controlled trials or conducted in-the-wild studies to evaluate the impact of HRSs, thereby showing that the field is slowly maturing. On the basis of our review, we derived five reporting guidelines that can serve as a reference frame for future HRS studies. HRS studies should clarify who the target user is and to whom the recommendations apply, what is recommended and how the recommendations are presented to the user, where the data set can be found, what algorithms were used to calculate the recommendations, and what evaluation protocol was used. Conclusions: There is significant opportunity for an HRS to inform and guide health actions. Through this review, we promote the discussion of ways to augment HRS research by recommending a reference frame with five design guidelines.","tags":["eHealth","Evaluation","Guidelines","Health","Healthcare","Health Recommender Systems","Layperson","Mobile Phone","Patient","Recommendation system","Recommender","Recommender Technique","Systematic Review","User Interface"],"title":"Health Recommender Systems: Systematic Review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor Štiglic","Fei Wang","Aziz Sheikh","Gregor Štiglic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619136000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619136000,"objectID":"fae6720aeb75c98456e754230c6eb690","permalink":"/publication/primcarediab_2021/","publishdate":"2021-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/primcarediab_2021/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we demonstrate the development and validation of the 10-years type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk prediction models based on large survey data.

Higher interpretability of the model means easier comprehension and explanation of future predictions for end-users.

Generally, we can classify interpretability approaches in two groups where the first focuses on personalized interpretation (local interpretability) while the second summarizes prediction models on a population level (global interpretability). Alternatively, we can group interpretability methods into model-specific techniques, which are designed to interpret predictions generated by a specific model, such as a neural network, and model-agnostic approaches, which provide easy-to-understand explanations of predictions made by any machine learning model. Here, we give an overview of interpretability approaches and provide examples of practical interpretability of machine learning in different areas of healthcare, including prediction of health-related outcomes, optimizing treatments or improving the efficiency of screening for specific conditions. Further, we outline future directions for interpretable machine learning and highlight the importance of developing algorithmic solutions that can enable machine-learning driven decision making in high-stakes healthcare problems.","tags":["Type 2 diabetes mellitus","Machine learning","Prediction models"],"title":"Early detection of type 2 diabetes mellitus using machine learning-based prediction models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leona Cilar Budler","Majda Pajnkihar, FAAN, FEANS","Gregor Štiglic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1586476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586476800,"objectID":"e5d88264b50f535b845249a291b7f9de","permalink":"/publication/icdm_2020/","publishdate":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icdm_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Questionnaire based screening tests have been widely used in different fields ranging from healthcare and psychology to business environment.

Oral healthcare education is a public health priority as the maintenance of oral hygiene is integral to overall health. Maintaining optimal oral hygiene among children is challenging and can be supported by using relevant motivational approaches. Objective: The primary aim of this study was to identify mobile phone applications (apps) that include gamification features focused on motivating children to learn, perform and maintain optimal oral hygiene. Methods: We searched six online app stores using four search terms ('oral hygiene game', 'oral hygiene gamification', 'oral hygiene brush game' and 'oral hygiene brush gamification'). The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed throughout the review. We identified gamification features, identified whether apps were consistent with evidence-based dentistry, we performed a quality appraisal with the user version of the app rating scale (uMARS) and we quantified the number of behaviour scores (Behaviour change score, uMARS score, and Coventry, Aberdeen and London-Refined [CALO-RE] score) using three different instruments that measure behavior change. Results: Of 612 potentially relevant apps included in the analysis, 17 met the inclusion criteria. On average, apps included 6.87 (standard deviation [SD] = 4.18) out of 31 possible gamification features. The most frequently used gamification features were time pressure (n = 16; 94%), virtual characters (n = 14; 82%) and fantasy (n = 13; 76%). The most common oral hygiene evidence-based recommendation was brushing time (2-3 minutes), which was identified in 94% (n = 16) of apps. The overall uMARS total mean for app quality was high (mean [M] = 4.30; SD = 0.36), with good subjective quality (M = 3.79; SD = 0.71) and perceived impact (M = 3.58; SD = 0.44).

Higher interpretability of the model means easier comprehension and explanation of future predictions for end-users. Further, interpretable machine learning models allow healthcare experts to make reasonable and data-driven decisions to provide personalized decisions that can ultimately lead to higher quality of service in healthcare. Generally, we can classify interpretability approaches in two groups where the first focuses on personalized interpretation (local interpretability) while the second summarizes prediction models on a population level (global interpretability). Alternatively, we can group interpretability methods into model-specific techniques, which are designed to interpret predictions generated by a specific model, such as a neural network, and model-agnostic approaches, which provide easy-to-understand explanations of predictions made by any machine learning model. Here, we give an overview of interpretability approaches and provide examples of practical interpretability of machine learning in different areas of healthcare, including prediction of health-related outcomes, optimizing treatments or improving the efficiency of screening for specific conditions. Further, we outline future directions for interpretable machine learning and highlight the importance of developing algorithmic solutions that can enable machine-learning driven decision making in high-stakes healthcare problems.","tags":["Interpretability","Prediction Models","Healthcare"],"title":"Interpretability of machine learning based prediction models in healthcare","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leon Kopitar","Leona Cilar Budler","Primož Kocbek","Gregor Štiglic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1578009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578009600,"objectID":"c75083a29d2f359b512a8e34c61ea828","permalink":"/publication/lncs_2019/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lncs_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Machine learning based predictive models have been used in different areas of everyday life for decades. However, with the recent availability of big data, new ways emerge on how to interpret the decisions of machine learning models. In addition to global interpretation focusing on the general prediction model decisions, this paper emphasizes the importance of local interpretation of predictions. Local interpretation focuses on specifics of each individual and provides explanations that can lead to a better understanding of the feature contribution in smaller groups of individuals that are often overlooked by the global interpretation techniques. In this paper, three machine learning based prediction models were compared: Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest (RF) and Generalized linear model with regularization (GLM). No significant differences in prediction performance, measured by mean average error, were detected: GLM: 0.573 (0.569 − 0.577); GBM: 0.579 (0.575 − 0.583); RF: 0.579 (0.575 − 0.583). Similar to other studies that used prediction models for screening in type 2 diabetes mellitus, we found a strong contribution of features like age, gender and BMI on the global interpretation level. On the other hand, local interpretation technique discovered some features like depression, smoking status or physical activity that can be influential in specific groups of patients. This study outlines the prospects of using local interpretation techniques to improve the interpretability of prediction models in the era of personalized healthcare. At the same time, we try to warn the users and developers of prediction models that prediction performance should not be the only criteria for model selection.","tags":["Machine Learning","Interpretation","Type 2 diabetes mellitus"],"title":"Local vs. global interpretability of machine learning models in type 2 diabetes mellitus screening","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Primož Kocbek","Nino Fijačko","Goran Hrovat","Bright I Nwaru","Paige Wickner","Aziz Sheikh","Gregor Štiglic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1573084800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573084800,"objectID":"beee49fe43a702843eebd656a262ff9d","permalink":"/publication/allergy_2019/","publishdate":"2019-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/allergy_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: There is a paucity of data on national trends in hospitalizations for allergic disorders. The aim of this study was to present recent trends in common allergic disorders. Methods: We used the National Inpatient Sample for the period 1998-2014 to analyze 130 million hospital discharge records of all age groups from four U.S. census regions for the following allergic disorders: allergic conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, anaphylaxis, angioedema, asthma, atopic eczema/dermatitis, drug allergy, food allergy, urticaria and venom allergy. Yearly age- and sex-standardized hospitalization rates and trends over the 17-year period we calculated using segmented generalized linear regression. The trends were reported as annual percentage change (APC) for one segment or average annual percentage change (AAPC) for multiple segments. Results: Increases in hospitalization rates at national and regional levels were observed for anaphylaxis (APC 2.1%, CI: 0.1,4.2) and angioedema (APC 3.3%, CI: 1.8,4.8). In contrast, decreases were observed in drug allergy (APC -6%, CI: -9.4,-3.1), urticaria (APC -3.3%, CI: -6.3,-0.5) and asthma (AAPC -1.8%, CI: -2.2,-1.4). Non-primary diagnoses, defined as up to 14 diagnoses following the primary diagnosis, showed some contrary trends, such as increases in asthma (AAPC 4.3%, CI: 4.1,4.5) and additional trends, such as increases in allergic rhinitis (AAPC 9.7%, CI: 8.8,10.6) and atopic eczema/dermatitis (APC 4.2%, CI: 3.6,4.6). Allergic conjunctivitis, food allergy, and venom allergy showed no change. Conclusions: Analysis of recent national hospitalization data for allergic disorders reveals a complex picture with some conditions showing increased hospitalization rates whilst others showed no change or a decline.","tags":["Allergic Disorder","Time trends"],"title":"National and regional hospitalization rates for allergic disorders in the United States : a 17 year time-trend analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor Štiglic","Roger Watson","Leona Cilar Budler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1571011200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571011200,"objectID":"28966c76352f02e4e7ea88d9a458ba1a","permalink":"/publication/res_nurs_2019/","publishdate":"2019-10-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/res_nurs_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"For conducting research, nurses typically use commercial statistical packages.
