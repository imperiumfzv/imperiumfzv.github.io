Espe-cially by deployment of such questionnaires in the online form it is now possible to collect large amounts of screening test data that can be used to study user char-acteristics and apply different data mining techniques to discover new patterns or build prediction models. We used a sample of 39775 complete depression, anxi-ety and stress scale questionnaires collected online. In practice such question-naires can be used to refer users to seek help from an advanced nurse practitioner specialized in mental health. Thus, modern technology enables healthcare work-ers to make clinical judgments based on evidence in advanced health assessment. Different data mining approaches were used to build prediction models and study user characteristics that might influence the prediction of screening test outcomes based on a limited number of questionnaire items. This study focuses on building prediction models to achieve high prediction performance by positioning of items using feature ranking. Additionally, we provide an insight into some characteris-tics of online screening test users using techniques to detect careless and insuffi-cient effort responding. Selection of smaller sets of items in screening tests can significantly reduce the time needed and workload for experts and lay population using the screening tests based on questionnaires. This paper also demonstrates the possibilities of using large survey datasets to provide guidelines that can serve experts in building screening tools of the next generation.","tags":["Data Mining","Stability of Prediction Models","Questionnaire Design","Screening Tests"],"title":"Interpreting influence of feature ranking in derivation of prediction models for screening questionnaires optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Improving interpretability and performance of risk prediction models for decision support in clinical environments\nMain host institution: KU Leuven\nSupervisor: Katrien Verbert (Informatics Section, KU Leuven)\nForeign host institution: University of Maribor\nSupervisor: Gregor Štiglic (FHS, University of Maribor)\n Website reference of the project on the Slovenian Current Research Information System (SICRIS).\nSummary\nRecently rediscovered and vastly improved neural network based techniques, commonly named deep learning techniques, are becoming increasingly popular as a predictive tool in different fields of healthcare. It was shown that deep learning techniques outperform less complex predictive models on many occasions, especially in cases where feature engineering is needed prior to prediction. On the other hand, deep learning based risk estimation allows very limited interpretation for healthcare experts or patients. To address this challenge, this project will research the embedding of deep learning models and feature extraction in visual analytics techniques. Visual analytics (VA) combines automated analysis with visualization techniques to gain insight into complex datasets and to support interpretability of models. More specifically, we will research how we can design, develop and evaluate interactive VA techniques on top of different prediction models for chronic diseases risk estimation, such as Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) .\nThe overall objective is twofold:\n  to explain the rationale of predictions as well as the uncertainty of these predictions to healthcare experts as a basis to support decision making and increase user trust, and\n  incorporating input and feedback from end-users in the prediction process, such as missing lab values and parameter refinement.

Oral healthcare education is a public health priority as the maintenance of oral hygiene is integral to overall health. Maintaining optimal oral hygiene among children is challenging and can be supported by using relevant motivational approaches. Objective: The primary aim of this study was to identify mobile phone applications (apps) that include gamification features focused on motivating children to learn, perform and maintain optimal oral hygiene. Methods: We searched six online app stores using four search terms ('oral hygiene game', 'oral hygiene gamification', 'oral hygiene brush game' and 'oral hygiene brush gamification'). The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed throughout the review. We identified gamification features, identified whether apps were consistent with evidence-based dentistry, we performed a quality appraisal with the user version of the app rating scale (uMARS) and we quantified the number of behaviour scores (Behaviour change score, uMARS score, and Coventry, Aberdeen and London-Refined [CALO-RE] score) using three different instruments that measure behavior change. Results: Of 612 potentially relevant apps included in the analysis, 17 met the inclusion criteria. On average, apps included 6.87 (standard deviation [SD] = 4.18) out of 31 possible gamification features. The most frequently used gamification features were time pressure (n = 16; 94%), virtual characters (n = 14; 82%) and fantasy (n = 13; 76%). The most common oral hygiene evidence-based recommendation was brushing time (2-3 minutes), which was identified in 94% (n = 16) of apps. The overall uMARS total mean for app quality was high (mean [M] = 4.30; SD = 0.36), with good subjective quality (M = 3.79; SD = 0.71) and perceived impact (M = 3.58; SD = 0.44). Sufficient amount of behavior change techniques based on three taxonomies was detected in each app. Conclusions: The majority of the analyzed oral hygiene apps included gamification features and behaviour change techniques to perform and maintain oral hygiene in children. Overall, the apps contain some educational content consistent with evidence-based dentistry and high quality background for performing oral self-care in children; however, there is scope for improvement.","tags":["Mobile Health","Oral Healthcare","Gamification","Mobile Application Rating Scale"],"title":"The Effects of Gamification and Oral Self-care on Oral Hygiene in Children: a Systematic Review of mHealth Apps","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gregor Štiglic","Primož Kocbek","Nino Fijačko","Marinka Zitnik","Katrien Verbert","Leona Cilar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582156800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582156800,"objectID":"418881813310eaedb4ace98c036d825d","permalink":"/publication/wires_2020/","publishdate":"2020-02-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wires_2020/","section":"publication","summary":"There is a need of ensuring machine learning models that are interpretable. Higher interpretability of the model means easier comprehension and explanation of future predictions for end-users. Further, interpretable machine learning models allow healthcare experts to make reasonable and data-driven decisions to provide personalized decisions that can ultimately lead to higher quality of service in healthcare. Generally, we can classify interpretability approaches in two groups where the first focuses on personalized interpretation (local interpretability) while the second summarizes prediction models on a population level (global interpretability). Alternatively, we can group interpretability methods into model-specific techniques, which are designed to interpret predictions generated by a specific model, such as a neural network, and model-agnostic approaches, which provide easy-to-understand explanations of predictions made by any machine learning model. Here, we give an overview of interpretability approaches and provide examples of practical interpretability of machine learning in different areas of healthcare, including prediction of health-related outcomes, optimizing treatments or improving the efficiency of screening for specific conditions. Further, we outline future directions for interpretable machine learning and highlight the importance of developing algorithmic solutions that can enable machine-learning driven decision making in high-stakes healthcare problems.","tags":["Interpretability","Prediction Models","Healthcare"],"title":"Interpretability of machine learning based prediction models in healthcare","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leon Kopitar","Leona Cilar","Primož Kocbek","Gregor Štiglic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1578009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578009600,"objectID":"c75083a29d2f359b512a8e34c61ea828","permalink":"/publication/lncs_2019/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lncs_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Machine learning based predictive models have been used in different areas of everyday life for decades. However, with the recent availability of big data, new ways emerge on how to interpret the decisions of machine learning models. In addition to global interpretation focusing on the general prediction model decisions, this paper emphasizes the importance of local interpretation of predictions. Local interpretation focuses on specifics of each individual and provides explanations that can lead to a better understanding of the feature contribution in smaller groups of individuals that are often overlooked by the global interpretation techniques. In this paper, three machine learning based prediction models were compared: Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest (RF) and Generalized linear model with regularization (GLM). No significant differences in prediction performance, measured by mean average error, were detected: GLM: 0.573 (0.569 − 0.577); GBM: 0.579 (0.575 − 0.583); RF: 0.579 (0.575 − 0.583). Similar to other studies that used prediction models for screening in type 2 diabetes mellitus, we found a strong contribution of features like age, gender and BMI on the global interpretation level. On the other hand, local interpretation technique discovered some features like depression, smoking status or physical activity that can be influential in specific groups of patients. This study outlines the prospects of using local interpretation techniques to improve the interpretability of prediction models in the era of personalized healthcare. At the same time, we try to warn the users and developers of prediction models that prediction performance should not be the only criteria for model selection.","tags":["Machine Learning","Interpretation","Type 2 diabetes mellitus"],"title":"Local vs. global interpretability of machine learning models in type 2 diabetes mellitus screening","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Primož Kocbek","Nino Fijačko","Goran Hrovat","Bright I Nwaru","Paige Wickner","Aziz Sheikh","Gregor Štiglic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1573084800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573084800,"objectID":"beee49fe43a702843eebd656a262ff9d","permalink":"/publication/allergy_2019/","publishdate":"2019-11-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/allergy_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: There is a paucity of data on national trends in hospitalizations for allergic disorders. The aim of this study was to present recent trends in common allergic disorders. Methods: We used the National Inpatient Sample for the period 1998-2014 to analyze 130 million hospital discharge records of all age groups from four U.S. census regions for the following allergic disorders: allergic conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, anaphylaxis, angioedema, asthma, atopic eczema/dermatitis, drug allergy, food allergy, urticaria and venom allergy. Yearly age- and sex-standardized hospitalization rates and trends over the 17-year period we calculated using segmented generalized linear regression. The trends were reported as annual percentage change (APC) for one segment or average annual percentage change (AAPC) for multiple segments. Results: Increases in hospitalization rates at national and regional levels were observed for anaphylaxis (APC 2.1%, CI: 0.1,4.2) and angioedema (APC 3.3%, CI: 1.8,4.8). In contrast, decreases were observed in drug allergy (APC -6%, CI: -9.4,-3.1), urticaria (APC -3.3%, CI: -6.3,-0.5) and asthma (AAPC -1.8%, CI: -2.2,-1.4). Non-primary diagnoses, defined as up to 14 diagnoses following the primary diagnosis, showed some contrary trends, such as increases in asthma (AAPC 4.3%, CI: 4.1,4.5) and additional trends, such as increases in allergic rhinitis (AAPC 9.7%, CI: 8.8,10.6) and atopic eczema/dermatitis (APC 4.2%, CI: 3.6,4.6). Allergic conjunctivitis, food allergy, and venom allergy showed no change.
