abstract="Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) using large pre-trained neural language models were recently used in various downstream tasks, such as text generation. In primary healthcare, such systems can generate very short summaries of research papers to save healthcare experts' time when browsing through the literature search results, especially in scenarios where the communication with a patient can be supported by the latest scientific literature immediately at the point of care.",
